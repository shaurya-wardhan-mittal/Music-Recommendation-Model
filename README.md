# Music-Recommendation-Model
Overview

This repository contains a music recommendation model built using the Neural Network (NN) algorithm. The model is designed to recommend songs based on the similarity of various features such as danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, and more. By analyzing a dataset of song characteristics, the KNN model identifies songs similar to a user's favorite tracks, making it an ideal tool for personalized music recommendations.

Features

Recommendation Algorithm: Neural Network (NN)
Song Features Considered: danceability, energy, tempo, loudness, key, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and duration
Scalable: Can be expanded with additional features or a larger dataset to improve recommendation quality
Requirements
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8+
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)

Model Details

Neural Network Architecture
The neural network architecture consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with fully connected layers. The architecture can be customized based on requirements:

Input Layer: Represents the song features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, etc.
Hidden Layers: Can be configured with varying numbers of neurons and layers to capture non-linear relationships between features.
Output Layer: Produces a similarity score or ranking of recommended songs.

Dataset

The model uses a dataset of songs where each song has various features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and loudness. Each row in the dataset represents a single song, with its respective features used for calculating similarity.

Features Used

The following features are used to calculate similarity:

Danceability
Energy
Key
Loudness
Mode
Speechiness
Acousticness
Instrumentalness
Liveness
Valence
Tempo
Duration (ms)
These features provide a multidimensional representation of each song, capturing key aspects of the music's style, mood, and structure.

Future Improvements

Additional Features: Consider adding metadata like genre or artist to improve recommendations.

Hybrid Model: Combine with collaborative filtering or other models for a more comprehensive system.

Real-Time Recommendations: Adapt the model to handle real-time recommendations as user data grows.
